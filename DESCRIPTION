Description: Some sites use Cloudflare's anti-DDoS protection to, well, avoid being 
    DDoS'd. However, many of these sites also host files that they intended for automated
    download workflows and often forget to exclude those from the heavy-handed anti-DDoS,
    javascript + human-required settings. Cloudflare employs a few different anti-DDoS 
    protection schemes. One involves a 503 HTTP response followed by the submission of a 
    "challenge" that was solved via a bit of javascript on the page. That's what this 
    pacakge handles. If you encounter other Cloudflare anti-DDoS protection schemes 
    (especially the captcha one), then this won't work.
